## Fork

`no-std-io2` is a fork of [no-std-io](https://github.com/no-std-io/no-std-io), which is a fork of [core2](https://github.com/technocreatives/core2).

## Overview

Ever wanted a `Cursor` or the `Error` trait in `no_std`? Well now you can have it. A 'fork' of Rust's `std` modules for `no_std` environments, with the added benefit of optionally taking advantage of `alloc`.

The goal of this crate is to provide a stable interface for building I/O and error trait functionality in
`no_std` environments. The current code corresponds to the most recent stable API of Rust 1.56.0.
It is also a goal to achieve a true alloc-less experience, with opt-in alloc support.

This crate works on `stable` with some limitations in functionality, and `nightly` without limitations by adding
the relevant feature flag.

This crate is `std` by default -- use no default features to get `no_std` mode.

## Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
no_std_io2 = "0.9"
```

Add the crate, use the things you would usually want from `std::io`, but instead from `no_std_io2::io`, and
use `no_std_io2::error::Error` in place of `std::error::Error`.

### Features

- **std**: enables `std` pass-throughs for the polyfilled types, but allows accessing the new types
- **alloc**: enable aspects of the `Read` and `Write` traits that require `alloc` support (WIP)
- **nightly**: enables **nightly**-only features.

### Differences to `std::io`

- No `std::io::Error`, so we have our own copy without any `Os` error functions
- `IoSlice` and the `*_vectored` family of functions are not implemented.
- `BufReader` and `BufWriter` have a different signature, as they now use a const generic bounded array for the internal buffer.

Other than items perhaps being entirely missing or certain functions unavailable on some traits, no function signatures have been changed.

### Limitations

- `Error` trait is not implemented for `!` because `never_type` feature is not yet stabilized.
